<p>Tanish Neema has experience in a variety of operating systems such as MacOS, Windows, Debian, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux. He has also had experience in a wide range of programming languages such as Python and C++.</p>
<p>Even though Tanish has experience on one project, The POGIL Project, this project has been on going for since fall of 2022 and he has been working on it in some sort of capacity ever since. Some of the things he has done on this project include:creating routes in python, adding features to the frontend through react and node.js, and create and maintain the SKILLBuilder project.</p>
<p>The website also details some small projects he has worked on.</p>
<p>While he is a Software Engineer, Tanish also enjoys playing video games, watching movies (mostly science fiction and anime), reading about cars (how they work and how one can improve their performance as he is a big car enthusiast and wants to get into drifting and drag racing), and listening 90s and early 2000s hiphop.</p>
